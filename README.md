# QUTMS_AV_Sim

## Overview

QUTMS_AV_Sim is designed to facilitate development of autonomous systems with little-to-no prior ROS 2 experience. Primarily, it is intended to be used by the Queensland University of Technology Motorsport (QUTMS) team to develop their autonomous vehicle software in ROS 2. However, it is open source and can be used by anyone.
It makes use of the [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) simulator for lightweight ROS 2 specific vehicle URDFs.

QUTMS has and continues to use in varying capacities, forked versions the Formula Student Driverless Simulator (FSDS) and the Edinburgh University Formula Student Simulator (EUFS Sim). Some Gazebos and ROS 2 plugins have also been forked from eufs_sim for this project.
